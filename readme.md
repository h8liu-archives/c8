An emulated CLI system in web browser that comes with its own
filesystem.

[Online Demo](http://h8liu.github.io/c8/)

The final goal is to have a working compiler with
[e8](http://github.com/h8liu/e8) VM running inside this "fake" OS.

### TODO

Any help is appreciated.

- Terminal colors.
- More common commands.
- More powerful command implementations.
- Auto-save and auto-sync for the file system.
